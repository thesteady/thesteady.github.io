The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) Colorado Aspirations Computing Award was held on April 27. I was honored to be invited to speak about my experiences as a woman in technology to the brilliant young minds being celebrated that night. Forty high school girls were recognized for their outstanding achievements in computing. The [Aspirations in Computing Awards](https://www.ncwit.org/programs-campaigns/aspirations-computing) is a national-program with the aim of encouraging young women to become and stay active in technology.

I spoke on what it's like to be a developer at a consulting company as awesome as Quick Left, and tried to share with them how exciting a career in technology can be -- it's not just sitting at a desk writing code all day!

It was truly inspiring to see how much they've already achieved. I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors!
